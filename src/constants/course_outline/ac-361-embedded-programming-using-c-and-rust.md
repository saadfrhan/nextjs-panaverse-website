### AC-361: Embedded Programming using C and Rust

Duration: 13 Weeks

#### Course Description

This is an introductory course about using the C and Rust Programming Languages on "Bare Metal" embedded systems, such as Microcontrollers. We will start by introducing embedded systems and move on to learn the  C++ and Rust programming languages. We'll learn about basic programming concepts using C and Rust, then we will explore key concepts in electronics, microcontrollers, and embedded programming. It is a fast-paced,  thorough introduction to programming with C and Rust that will have you writing programs, solving problems, burning your code on microcontrollers,  playing with GPIOs, and making things that work in no time.
