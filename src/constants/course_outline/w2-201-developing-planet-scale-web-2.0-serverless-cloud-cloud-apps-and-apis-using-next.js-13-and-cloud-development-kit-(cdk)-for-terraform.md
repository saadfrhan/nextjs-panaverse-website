Must Have: Create Free AWS Account

[AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)

Note: For AWS Free Tier you will need a credit or debit card. The easiest way for Pakistani students is to open a bank account with Meezan Bank. Open a Meezan Aasan Account if you have no earning proof. Meezan Bank will charge Rs. 1100 for ATM Debit Card and there is a requirement of Rs. 100 minimum deposit. The card will be delivered in a few weeks. Our students have reported that this Debit card works with AWS.

Now you can create a virtual VISA Debit card through the NayaPay app (<https://www.nayapay.com/> ) which can be used to create AWS/GCP/Azure accounts. This is good news for those students who find it difficult to create physical debit and credit cards from banks.

You can also get a $300 credit
