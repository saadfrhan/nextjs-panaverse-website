### MV-361: Developing Planet-Scale Open Virtual and Augmented Metaverse Experiences

Duration: 13 Weeks

##### <ins>Course Description</ins>

The Web is the Metaverse. The metaverse requires an infrastructure that connects all of the metaverses so that we can travel between them. This is only achievable with open web-based metaverses. The internet and its browsers are magical. Federated but linked experiences connect pages, people, technology, businesses, standards, and nations. It's unlike anything else. The metaverse should replicate the best qualities of the web - it should just be the web. We just have to extend online responsive design from mobile to desktop to 3D, Augmented Reality, and Virtual Reality. This course will teach you how to build the Open Social Spatial Web with WebXR and WebGPU technologies.
