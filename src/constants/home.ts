The first three quarters are shared by all specialties and are dedicated to studying Object-Oriented Programming and cutting-edge Full-Stack Web 2.0 development. It is going to be a fifteen-month-long hybrid program that includes both onsite and online classes and is divided into five quarters of 13 weeks each. The emphasis will be on hands-on learning by educating students to produce projects. To accommodate everyone, courses will be held primarily on weekends or after 6:00 p.m. (Pakistan Time) on weekdays. It employs a hybrid teaching format, with core onsite classes complemented by online Zoom laboratories and recorded videos."

This would give Pakistani professionals and students a fantastic opportunity to better their financial situation while also giving the economy a much-needed boost by expanding software exports."
